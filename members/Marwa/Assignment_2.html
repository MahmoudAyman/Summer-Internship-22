                <h1> Task idea !!:</h1>
                <p> First of all you might wonder why the phone holder is my choice to fabricate it as my first laser cutting task.
Actually, I decided to fabricate something that helps me to do my lovely hobby which is video records.<p>
 <p> As you can see in those photos I have a youtube channel in which I give people some courses and helpful advice <p>

 <img src="images/you.png" height="50%" width="65%">


 <p>And this photo is my Facebook page <p>

 <img src="images/face.png" height="50%" width="65%">
<p>so that was the reason behind selecting a phone holder as the first task.
Actually, I am not a popular person and I do not have many followers ,but I love speaking with people <p>
 
            
                               
 <h1>Design Process </h1>
                <p> when I decided to make my task I started to search for designs idea, but there was a problem with some designs </p>

<p> The following designs are designs that help in standing the phone vertical and that was not my choice because I was searching for a holder that helps me to put my phone horizontally. </p> 
 <img src="images/ver1.png" height="40%" width="40%">
 <img src="images/ver2.png" height="40%" width="40%">

         
      <p> Then when I searched for a horizontal phone holder design I found all designs are very short as in the photo and I need a phone holder that has a little bit high. </p>
  <img src="images/hor.png" height="40%" width="40%">

      <p> So I decided to make my own design and the first step that I did was the free hand sketch for the requirements that I need. </p>

      <p> Then I decided to draw each part using SolidWorks software my parts were :
<br> 1-Base 
 <br> 2-Rod
<br> 3-Plate 
<br> 4-Arm 

 <br> AS shown in the following figures.
 </p>

    
 <img src="images/base.png" height="40%" width="40%">  
 <img src="images/plate.png" height="40%" width="40%">  
 <img src="images/rod.png" height="40%" width="40%">  
 <img src="images/arm.png" height="40%" width="40%">  

               <p> The last design step was to assemble all those individual parts together to make sure all parts dimensions are fitting each other <p>
<p> And as  I was very happy with my design I took many pictures of it<p>
 <img src="images/ass1.png" height="40%" width="40%">  
 <img src="images/ass2.png" height="40%" width="40%">  
 <img src="images/ass3.png" height="40%" width="40%">  


                <h1>Design Modefication </h1>


          <p> While designing I asked<b> Eng Mahmoud Ayman</b> to help me select the best accuracy to make my design self-fastinated with out any glue or fasteners and he told me to make the length of the hole in the Base smaller than the length of the rod 0.2 mm <P>             <img src="">

<p> I wanted to add a cute cat Pic  as shown on my base ,but unfornately solid works didnot help me at all as well as RDworks and i didnot solve this problem till now .<P>

                 <img src="images/cat.png" height="40%" width="40%">  


                <h1>Converting CAD Files to CAM  </h1>
<p> I saved each part of my design as dxf format then I used a software called RDworks to make my file ready for the fabrication process <p>
<p> i sued text option in the program to write my name on the front plate of my holder.<P>
<P> My cutting speed was 25 and power was 75.<P>
<P> My scannig Speed was 100 and power 20. <P>
<P> this photo shows my parts in RDworks , but the monitor <b>Eng  Anas </b> helped me to make the parts closer  as shown in the second pic to prevent wasting much wood.  <P>
                             <img src="images/B.png" height="40%" width="40%">  
                 <img src="images/A.png" height="40%" width="40%">  

                
                <h1> Fabrication </h1>
<P> I used 3 mm wood to make my holder and it took less than one minute on the machine. <P>
                                <img src="images/m1.jpeg" height="40%" width="40%">  
                 <img src="images/m2.jpeg" height="40%" width="40%">  

<h1> Testing </h1>
<P> when the machine finished my parts I started to assemble them together and the monitor <b>Eng Tarek</b> helped me to make this, Actually, the phone which we make my test was his phone  <P>
                                <img src="images/design.jpeg" height="40%" width="40%">  
                 <img src="images/t2.jpeg" height="40%" width="40%">  

<h1> Conclusion</h1>
<P> <b> I want to say that I was very very happy to make something that I love and need to produce many videos. </b> <p>

<P><b>Even if this achievement is small, I am very happy because I did my own design to some thing that i love and want.</b> <P>

<p> <b>I will be very happy if you supported me on <br> my Facebook acount <mark>https://www.facebook.com/MarwaElbadawy9321</mark> <br> and youtube channel <mark>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHxyl1i53o1C4M5_ySwGFSg/featured</mark>.</b> <p>
