                <h1>Objective</h1>
                <p>The main objective was to allow the user to use the soldring wire with ease. And the holder should have some sort of mechanism in order to be hanged on the workstation. With also an important functionality, where the holder must be protable.</p>
                
                
                               
                <h1>Step 1:(Initial design)</h1>
                <p>With all this restrictions in mind, the best idea that came in my mind was simply a desing that is similar to a coat hanger. Where it could be hung on the workstation and it would also be protable. The hanger had other functionalities where it had space for more than one soldering wire case and also it had a circular path where the user could take soldering wire without removing  the hanger from its place. If the path was rectangular then it would have high friction which wouldn't allow the user to take the soldering wire without removing it. The design also had a curve at the end to prevent the soldering wire from falling when moving the hanger.</p>

                <h1>Step 2:</h1>
                <p>The initial design had some issues. Where the curve made to hold the wire tube was too large. And the part made to hold the hanger wasn't that efficient and didn't work with the workstation design. Therefore, a modification has to made and we turned this part into T shaped. For more information on how te T shape is going to be used with the workstation visit Fatma's documentation about the project.  </p>

                <h1>Step 3:</h1>
                <p>The design had some other flaws where the T shape hight was too small, therefore, it didn't fit with the slots made to hold the part. And also the curve made was too large so the soldering wire didn't fit in it.   </p>

                <h1>Step 4:</h1>
                <p>Adjustments had to be made to the desing in order for the design to  work. However, we are going to try two other designs and see which design is more compatible with the project.</p>
		<p>The first idea was to make a flexible joint where we could use this joint is used as a hanger and with two of this design we could hang a soldering wire between them.</p>
		<p>The second idea was to use the soldering wire hanger of the second assignment and hang them on the two rods of the workstation.</p>
